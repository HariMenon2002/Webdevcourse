Creators of frontend frameworks realised that all websites can be effectively divided into two parts ie. state and components

State-An object that represents current state of the app.It represents the dynamic things in your app(ie the things that change). eg.
{
    topbar:{
        home:0,
        mynotification:"99+",
        myjobs:0,
        messages:10
    }
}

components- How a DOM element should render given a state.It is re-usable, dynamic ,HTML snippet that changes given the state eg. button

Give react the state, the components and how they are structured together, the relation between them, react does updation itself

A state change triggers a re-render. A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes

You usually have to define all your components once and then all you have to do  is to update the state of your app.React takes care of re-rendering of the app
