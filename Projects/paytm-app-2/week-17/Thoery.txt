1.Where to start - Feature planning
2.Design UI/UX
UX - First principles/Copy the biggest website out there
UI - Designer. Today there are tools but havent found any good one
3.High level Design
Auth provider
Database
Backend Stack
Frontend stack
Modules you’ll have (common/ui/backend)
Cloud to deploy to
4.LLD
Schema
Route signatures
Frontend Components - debatable
5.ER Diagrams - 
We can build these today, but usually not needed unless you’re a very visual person
6.How to think about features
Usually come from product
If you’re a founder, then just whatever u think is right
7.How much complexity is needed
Depends on the size of the company. For a startup, whatever helps you move fast w/o tech debt. For a company there are a lot of layers of review to go through

You can add a merchant section as well for this, but for now we will focus only on user section
You will need a frontend and backend for the app. You will also need a seperate backend to interact with the bank webhook
Also  a queue(sweeper) for transactions back to bank from wallet.
