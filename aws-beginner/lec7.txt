Steps of deploying a frontend in AWS

Note :This will not work for frameworks that use server side rendering(eg Nextjs).This will work for basic react apps, Html/css/js apps

1.In my local terminal,First create a project using npm create vite@latest and select typescript. Then cd to that project and do npm install 
2.Another thing to note is that you cant deploy .tsx files and all that, you will need to convert it to basic html/css/js which the browser understands
        So do npm run build    , this will create a dist folder which is imp which we will distribute over the internet.It has index.html, an assets folder having js and css file etc

3.You cant directly display the html file in the browser. Do npm install -g serve   and then cd to dist folder and run the command   serve
What this does is, it will serve all the files in the dist folder on a port(say http://localhost:3000/index.html).All this is to just show locally. So i am able to serve my files on a port. 

4.These files are actually what I want to upload to S3
