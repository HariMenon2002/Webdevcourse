Creating a reverse proxy 

After connecting domain to nginx, now we have to create a reverse proxy. For that we need to create nginx config files.Do the following commands

sudo rm /etc/nginx/nginx.conf            ie deleting original default config file
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

now in this paste

events {
    # Event directives...
}

http {
	server {
    listen 80;
    server_name a.com;                  

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
	}
	server {
    listen 80;
    server_name b.com;                  

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8081;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
	}
}


Then do sudo nginx -s reload      to restart nginx

Now do cd sum-server/ and then do node index.js to run it
Then go to a.com/todos 


Side note:
suppose in my local machine i want google.com to point to another ip. First come back to your normal local terminal(not aws) and do sudo vi /etc/hosts

Then in that add 209.22.21.34  google.com
