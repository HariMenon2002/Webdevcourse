cd to sum-server folder after doing steps in lec1 in the aws terminal.
Install nvm and then nodejs.(This is a beginner way to deploy applications, later on we will use docker)
Type node and check if it is executing
Do npm install and then do node index.js. Now according to the program, it should be running on port 8080(as app.listen(8080)) but we have not opened the port 8080 in aws. 
So in instances, click on your instance(tick) and select security.Click on the given security group and click on inbound rules, then select edit inbound rules. Select add a rule, then custom tcp, add port 8080 and select anywhere from ipv4 option. Then again select add a rule, then custom tcp, add port 8080 and select anywhere from ipv6 option
 
Now in browser do ip_of_your_instance:8080/todos. You can also use the domain name of instance given by aws:8080/todos. Thus you are able to deploy a simple nodejs app. 

It is very ugly to put :8080 everytime, but you cant put app.listen(80) (80 is the default port)for every program as  diff programs which are run by the same aws machine cant have same port.
