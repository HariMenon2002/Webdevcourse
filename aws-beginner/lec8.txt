Creating an object store in AWS steps   
In AWS, go to S3 section and create a bucket(just give bucket name and keep rest default)(by default public access is blocked for this)

Drag and drop all the files in the dist folder in this bucket(dont put it as a dist folder, put them seperately)

Go to cloudfront and click on create distribution.The origin domain should be the domain link(...com) of the bucket
In Origin access(how can cloudfront access your bucket) click on Origin access control settings.Click on create a new OAC and select sign requests in that and click on create. Enable security protections , put default root object as index.html(ie by default, cloudfront url should take us to index.html)at the bottom and rest all is default. Then click on create distribution.It will create a distribution and also a s3 policy which we should copy

Now we have to update S3 bucket policy.Go to permissions page of our bucket and in bucket policy, click on edit bucket policy and paste the above copied policy.

The newly created distribution will have a domain name(...net). Copy and paste in browser and check.
