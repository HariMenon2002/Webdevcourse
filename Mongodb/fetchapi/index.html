            });  //by default this is get request
            //for post you can do ,method="POST"

                       Authentication
Hashing is one way ie once it is hashed, you cant get original from it, Encryption is two way, ie once you know the key with which the data was encrypted, you can get the original data

Json web tokens- works for only json data,it takes json input and converts it to token which is a very long string.But the weird thing is that whoever has this output(token) can also see the input thus decoding can be done by anyone.But Verification is done on the server with help of password 

Once i login , website gives me a token, and each time i request something in it, this token is also sent for verification in the header. This token is basically stored in local storage for testing
