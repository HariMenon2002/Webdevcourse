//For cloning one of my own repos

git clone <url..>                  //this makes sure that everything is now set to that repository thus we dont have to do git init,git remote and all that    //then do cd to that location
 //after making changes
git add .
git status

git commit -m "message"
git remote -v                      //just checking

git push                       	   // no need of origin master


//For creating branches

git checkout -b <branch name>     //to create a branch and move to it
git branch                        //to view all my branches

git checkout master           // to go back to master branch
git checkout <branch name>

//suppose i add a file now , this will not be visible in my master branch though

git diff <branch name>     //go to master and do this ,this will give the difference between the two file

//now if you want you can directly do get merge <branch name> here to merge with master but we usually do this with a pull request

git checkout <branch name>

git push -u origin <branch name>

//now a pull request appears in github
//go and create the pull request

//as this is my own repository , i can merge it as well

//to delete the branch, go to master branch and do 
git branch -d <branch name>
